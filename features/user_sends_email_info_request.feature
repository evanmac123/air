# TODO: This is broken. Fix.

#@javascript
#Scenario: User requests through the top box
#  Given I am on the new marketing page
#  When I enter "James Hennessey IX" in the name field of the top email info box
#  And I enter "james@henhen.com" in the email field of the top email info box
#  And I submit the top email info box
#  And DJ cranks once
#  #And "vlad@hengage.com" opens the email with subject "Somebody requested more information about The H Engages!"
#  And "vlad@hengage.com" opens the email
#  Then they should see "James Hennessey IX" in the email body
#  And they should see "james@henhen.com" in the email body
