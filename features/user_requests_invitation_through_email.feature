  Scenario: User requests invitation via email
    When "alpha@join.com" sends email with subject "I Tarzan, You Jane" and body "join"
    And DJ cranks 5 times
    Then "alpha@join.com" should receive an email
    When "alpha@join.com" opens the email
    And I click the play now button in the email
    Then I should be on the invitation page for "alpha@join.com"
    And I should see "Your Email Address:"
    And I should not see "Enter your email address"
    And I should see "Enter your mobile number"
    And I should see "Welcome to H Engage"
    When I fill in "Enter your mobile number" with "(208) 366-6066"
    And I fill in "Enter your name" with "Josh Groban"
