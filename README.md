Airbo Git Flow
--------------

1. Create a feature branch off of `development`.  The branch should be prefixed with an issue number of the first issue you are working on in the branch.  Ex: `git checkout -b 111_example_feature_branch`
2. Push your feature branch to GitHub and create a pull request.  This will trigger Semaphore and CodeClimate to run checks as you develop and let the team know what you are working on.  Prefix the name of the pull request with 'WIP' while your are still working on the branch (work in progress).
3. Push to GitHub as you develop in order to continue running checks.  If you are working on a branch for an extended period of time, periodically pull `development` and rebase `developmet` onto your feature branch. Ex: `git rebase development 111_example_feature_branch`
4. When development is complete, rebase `developmet` onto your feature branch and squash commits to a single commit with a commit message that details the issues that will be closed. Remove 'WIP' from the pull request name. When pushing to GitHub after you squash your commits, you will have to force push.
    ```
    git rebase development 111_example_feature_branch
    git rebase -i development 111_example_feature_branch
    git push origin 111_example_feature_branch -f
    ```

5. Before merging your pull request:
  * Make sure Semaphore passes
  * Make sure all the CodeClimate checks pass
  * Ask for code review on your pull request if needed
  * Deploy to Staging and QA
6. Merge pull requests from the GitHub GUI and delete your feature banch in the same GUI after merging.

Deploying
---------

To deploy to staging:

  * Option 1: Deploy from Semaphore
  * Option 2: `git push staging ${branch}:master -f`

To deploy to production:

  * Option 1: `script/deploy_production`
      * This:
        1. runs `git push production development:master`
        2. runs `heroku restart -a hengage`
        3. runs `heroku run rake db:migrate -a hengage`
        4. runs `script/airbrake_deploy_production`

  * Option 2: `git push production development:master && heroku restart -a hengage && heroku run rake db:migrate -a hengage`
    * Set deploy for Airbrake:
      1. Make sure `AIRBRAKE_PRODUCTION_PROJECT_ID` and `AIRBRAKE_PRODUCTION_API_KEY` ENV vars are set.
      2. `script/airbrake_deploy_production`

Laptop setup
------------

### Mac
[Thoughtbot Laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) is a script to set up a Mac OS X laptop for Rails development.

Or just install [homebrew](http://brew.sh) then do brew install postgres, redis, mongodb, Qt, ImageMagick  

Many Mac users use [Textmate](http://macromates.com/) to write their code.
If you use Textmate, set your tabs to "Soft Tabs: 2". This is one of the drop-down options at the very bottom of your window.

### (We Don't Do) Windows

### Linux
The following instructions are for an Ubuntu system; some slight modifications may need to be made for other distributions.

#### Install the following packages
1. build-essential
2. git
3. postgresql
4. mongodb
5. libqtwebkit-dev
6. libpq-dev
7. nodejs
8. ImageMagick
9. elasticsearch
10. pgadmin3 (Optional: PostgreSQL GUI admin tool)
11. curl (Optional: If using RVM - see below)

Since the _Package Manager_ is used to install these packages they might not be as up-to-date as needed.
If this is the case you will need to go to the appropriate site to get the latest and greatest version.

#### Git
Run the following commands:

    git config --global user.name "Joe Blow"
    git config --global user.email "joe@hengage.com"

#### PostgreSQL

Getting Postgres authentication can be a bit tricky, especially if you've never done it before. There is a simple authentication config file available at https://github.com/vladig17/hengage/wiki/Development-pg_hba.conf. However, YOU MUST NEVER USE THIS CONFIGURATION IN PRODUCTION BECAUSE IT IS TOTALLY INSECURE. IT IS FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY.

To get started. copy the configuration from the address above to `/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/` (version number might be different) and restart Postgres.

Then you'll need to create a database user (Postgres keeps its own lists of users separate from the system's) to use:

    $ sudo su postgres
    $ createuser joe # this should be the same as your system username

It will ask if the new user should be a superuser: say yes. Again, this is fine for a development machine but not a production server.

####  Use  [RBENV](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [CHRUBY](https://medium.com/@heidar/switching-from-rbenv-to-postmodern-s-ruby-install-and-chruby-f0daa24b36e6#.hl85swk6r) if you have need to support multiple ruby versions *

If opting for chruby with ruby-install, you can install ruby 2.0.0 with this command:

    ruby-install -M https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby ruby 2.0.0-p645

Aliases for faster workflow
---------------------------

Git aliases: add to ~/.gitconfig

    [alias]
      up = !git fetch origin && git rebase origin/master
      mm = !test `git rev-parse master` = $(git merge-base HEAD master) && git checkout master && git merge HEAD@{1} || echo "Non-fastforward"

Shell aliases: add to ~/.aliases

    alias be="bundle exec"
    alias s="bundle exec rspec"
    alias cuc="bundle exec cucumber"

 * For the aliases to take effect, add this to your ~/.bash_profile:

    if [ -e "$HOME/.aliases" ]; then
      source "$HOME/.aliases"
    fi


Setting up the app itself
-------------------------

Get the HEngage source code:

    git clone git@github.com:vladig17/hengage.git

Install the dependent Ruby libraries:

    bundle

Create your development and test databases. (Note: Two distinct steps: 1 for development and 1 for test):

    rake db:create

Load the development database:

    rake db:schema:load

Prepare the test database:

    rake db:test:prepare

You need to create one user before firing up the app, so after you've cloned the repository and got everything
else set up, fire up a Rails console and create a (claimed, admin) user thusly (password must have at least 6 characters):

    user = FactoryGirl.build :user, :claimed, name: 'Joe Blow', password: 'joeblow', password_confirmation: 'joeblow', email: 'joe@blow.com', is_site_admin: true
    user.save

Staging and production environments
-----------------------------------

We're using Heroku as a hosting provider. Deploying to Heroku is done via git. So, set up your git remotes for each environment:

    git remote add staging git@heroku.com:hengage-staging.git
    git remote add production git@heroku.com:hengage.git


Running the app
---------------

To run the app locally:

    1. `script/airbo_dev_up` will start workers, redis, and elastic search as well as serve as a log.
    2. `rails s`

Running the tests
-----------------

Our CI runs with the following script:

  `bundle exec rspec -fd -t ~broken:true; bundle exec rspec --only-failures`

This will run all tests not flagged for removal and then rerun failures one time.

Heroku
------

To access data on Heroku:

    heroku console --remote staging
    heroku console --remote production

This will drop you into a Rails console for either environment. You can run ActiveRecord queries from there.

To dump staging or production data into your development environment:

    heroku db:pull --remote staging
    heroku db:pull --remote production

We can create a database backup at any time:

    heroku pgbackups:capture --remote production

View database backups:

    heroku pgbackups --remote production

To destroy a backup:

    heroku pgbackups:destroy b003 --remote production

Transfer production data to staging:

    heroku pgbackups:capture --remote production
    heroku pgbackups:restore DATABASE `heroku pgbackups:url --remote production` --remote staging

CONFIG vars
-----------
Make sure to set these vars as appropriate.  Below is for example purpose only

| Var                        |Value                   | Purpose                      |

THE DREADED BULK LOADER
Some notes on the actual session below...
If you start with an XLS file => need to convert to CSV =>
* No spaces in filename
* Delete the first row (which names the fields)
First load the CSV file to Amazon S3.
Instructions for accessing S3 are above.
Bulk-load files are stored in the hengage-tmp bucket.

Perform locally to make sure can process entire file without errors before creating/updating users in production database:
* Make sure redis-server and delayed-job worker are running.
* Create a demo to hold the users (all of which will be created because none already exist to be updated).
** The one created below has an id of 41
** REMEMBER TO SUBSTITUTE THE DEMO_ID OF THE DEMO IN PRODUCTION WHEN YOU DO THIS FOR REAL!

Basically you run a rake task which consists of a chopper and a feeder...
chopper: Parses the binary blob of data in the S3 bucket for processing by a redis server, which is redis-server locally and at redistogo.com when you do this for real.
It will produce one redis record: the key is the filename and the value is a queue of all of the csv records => could be a pretty big queue.
It then creates a feeder, which is a delayed job which grabs each entry from the queue and creates a delayed job for it which, when run, will either create or update the user in the csv record.
This means that the number of resque queue elements should be decreasing while the number of delayed jobs are increasing.
* Given that there are typically 5 workers running in production, when you do this for real they should be able to handle the jobs as soon as they are created.
* You can monitor the number of delayed jobs by opening up a Rails console and entering “Delayed::Job.count” repeatedly.
* To monitor the number of elements in the queue you need to create a redis client from which to issue commands to the redis server.
Fire up a Rails console (because we use a Ruby library to make things easier):
redis = Redis.new URL
redis.llen <key>
* You do not need to specify the URL when running locally.
* For “real”, you get the URL from heroku configuration (which appears in the console-session output below).
* The <key> is filename (you want the length of its value, which is the queue of csv elements)
* Other redis commands can be found at: http://redis.io/commands (the 'llen' command is under 'Lists')

To create rules and acts for a user's activity feed:

Create a Rule in "site_admin" for the demo.
* One of the Ks typically does this.
* Since we are creating acts for the users activity feeds we want a valid description but a rule value that users won't discover by accident. Here is a good example from the Heineken demo d. r is the Rule and rv its RuleValue:

irb(main):108:0> d

Now create an act for each user. Note that you have to set the text to something (typically the rule's description) because if you don't the created act will have its "hidden" attribute set to "true" => won't show up in the feed.
