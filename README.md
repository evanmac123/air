Developer Machine Setup
------------

### Mac Only
Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh) then do brew install postgres, redis, mongodb, Qt, ImageMagick, elasticsearch 

Git should be installed on your Mac if it's not do: brew install git.


#### Install Ruby Manager
Use  [RBENV](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [CHRUBY](https://medium.com/@heidar/switching-from-rbenv-to-postmodern-s-ruby-install-and-chruby-f0daa24b36e6#.hl85swk6r) if you have need to support multiple ruby versions *

If opting for chruby with ruby-install, you can install ruby 2.0.0 with this command:

    ruby-install -M https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby ruby 2.0.0-p645


Airbo App Setup
------------
Get the HEngage source code:

    git clone git@github.com:vladig17/hengage.git

Install the dependent Ruby libraries:

    bundle

Create your development and test databases. (Note: Two distinct steps: 1 for development and 1 for test):

    rake db:create

Load the development database:

    rake db:schema:load

Prepare the test database:

    rake db:test:prepare

You need to create one user before firing up the app, so after you've cloned the repository and got everything
else set up, fire up a Rails console and create a (claimed, admin) user thusly (password must have at least 6 characters):

    user = User.new({name: 'Joe Blow', password: 'joeblow', password_confirmation: 'joeblow', email: 'joe@blow.com', is_site_admin: true, accepted_invitation_at: Date.today})
    user.save


### Environment Variables

Make sure to set these vars as appropriate. You can ignore the ones marked as Heroku Only in your local environment

#### Notes
1. IE9 cannot handle more than 4096 css selectors per css file. We use css splitter to split large css files into IE9 digestable chunks here we set the max number of selectors to 3072.  This is below the 4096 limit because there appears to be a file size limit in IE9 as well but that has been hard to confirm. Setting the max selectors to 3072 hopefully keeps the file size below the limit if it exists.

3. AWS_ERROR_BASE = https://s3.amazonaws.com/heroku_error_page

### Running App locally

To run the app locally:

    1. `script/airbo_dev_up` will start workers, redis, and elastic search as well as serve as a log.
    2. `rails s`

### Running the tests locally

  `bundle exec rspec -fd -t ~broken:true; bundle exec rspec --only-failures`

This will run all tests ignoring those flaggged as broken (to be removed) and then rerun failures one time.

Our CI runs this exact script after every push to github

Committing Code
---------------

### Airbo Git Workflow


1. Create a feature branch off of `development`.  The branch should be prefixed with an issue number of the first issue you are working on in the branch.  Ex: `git checkout -b 111_example_feature_branch`
2. Push your feature branch to GitHub and create a pull request.  This will trigger Semaphore and CodeClimate to run checks as you develop and let the team know what you are working on.  Prefix the name of the pull request with 'WIP' while your are still working on the branch (work in progress).
3. Push to GitHub as you develop in order to continue running checks.  If you are working on a branch for an extended period of time, periodically pull `development` and rebase `developmet` onto your feature branch. Ex: `git rebase development 111_example_feature_branch`
4. When development is complete, rebase `developmet` onto your feature branch and squash commits to a single commit with a commit message that details the issues that will be closed. Remove 'WIP' from the pull request name. When pushing to GitHub after you squash your commits, you will have to force push.
    ```
    git rebase development 111_example_feature_branch
    git rebase -i development 111_example_feature_branch
