      <h2>A new way to get attention, without a ton of extra work</h2>
      <p>
        Janet McNichol, Director of Human Resources at ASHA, needed to find new ways to capture the attention of busy employees. Communications were already being posted to the intranet, Facebook, her blog 
        <a href="http://www.insideworkplacewellness.com/" target="_new">Inside Workplace Wellness</a>, and sent in weekly emails. Janet wanted a system that incorporated new technologies like mobile and gamification, but she simply didn’t have the time to take on a lot of new work.
      </p>

      <h2>Making content creation easy</h2>
      <p>Today, over 89% of employees have activated their accounts on the ASHA Board. Janet creates 4 to 6 posts each week about diverse topics, from introducing new hires to promoting wellness challenges. Janet sends an automatically generated email with the new posts once a week to all employees, prompting everyone to scan “what’s new” and earn points for engaging toward a prize like a Kindle Paperwhite.</p>

      <h2>Building a community of engagement</h2>
      <p>After the ASHA Board’s launch, Janet was approached by a number of colleagues who also wanted to post content, like key points from staff meetings for people that didn’t have a chance to attend. And, employees started encouraging their colleagues to participate. Over a third of participants were recruited to the ASHA Board by another colleague and 70% have made at least one connection with a colleague.</p>

      <h2>Metrics to support any objective</h2>
      <p>One of the key uses of the ASHA Board has been to promote open positions. Participants earn points each time they share a job post on their Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn page. Using the ASHA Board’s analytics, Janet was able to show that in the first 8 weeks, 13 jobs were shared 289 times by over 70 people on their personal social networks, reaching an estimated 10,000 people.</p>
