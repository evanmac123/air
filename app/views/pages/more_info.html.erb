			<p>As a user interacts with Tiles, an activity feed entry is created. Users can connect to one another to see their connection’s activities and create a scoreboard. Our data shows these mechanics increase user engagement by over 30%. Historically, up to 45% of participants join Airbo because a peer recruited them.</p>
