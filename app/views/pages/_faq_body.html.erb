</h2>
<div class="Standard">
H.Engage is a social, mobile game that helps you learn about your benefits and take healthy actions. 
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--2"></a>How can I earn points?
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
Look for the fun, colorful squares, called tiles on Hengage.com or hung around your work location. Read them and follow the instructions! Each tile will include commands (words or phrases) that you can send to H.Engage for points.
</div>
<div class="Standard">
You can also earn points for eating healthy and for doing healthy activities. We think we’ve covered all the common – and not so common – activities and healthy foods, but if you find one the system doesn’t recognize, you can send “S” to suggest we add it.
</div>
<div class="Standard">
Here are some examples of healthy commands:

<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--3"></a>What about earning social points?
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
Games are more fun when you’re playing with other people!
</div>
<div class="Standard">
Earn 5 points for each coworker you sign up. Invite your coworkers on HEngage.com or have them respond to their welcome text or email with your game user name (so you get credit for referring them).
</div>
<div class="Standard">
You can also connect with coworkers to see how they’re playing the game. To connect with someone, search for them in the “Directory” and click “Add to friends.” Your coworker will be notified and asked to confirm that they know you.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--4"></a>What’s a command?
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
A command is a word or phrase that you send to H.Engage to earn points. It lets us know when you take an action or find a game piece.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--5"></a>How can I find out how many points I have or how many tickets I’ve earned?
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
You can find your ticket count (and how many points you need to get to earn the next ticket) on your homepage on HEngage.com. You’ll also receive an update on your points and ticket count each time you send in a command.
</div>
<h1 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--2"></a>The Basics
</h1>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--6"></a>Does it cost anything to play?
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
There is no cost to join, but standard message and data rates do apply so there may be some costs associated with the use of this service. For example, your pager or cellular phone service provider may charge you to send or receive wireless text messages.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--7"></a>Where can I find my user name?
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
Your user name was listed in the welcome message you received when you first signed up for the game. You can also find it by sending MYID or taking a look at the <a class="URL" href="/account/settings/edit">Settings</a> page.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--8"></a>What if I don’t want to play by text messaging?
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
Text messaging makes the game fun, but it’s certainly not required.
</div>
<div class="Standard">
You can play by emailing commands to <a href='mailto:<%= @current_user.demo.email %>'><%= @current_user.demo.email %></a>, or by submitting them on HEngage.com. You’ll receive a response via email or in the dialog box below the activity entry box on HEngage.com. Hint: watch the dialog box for any additional commands.
</div>
<div class="Standard">
If you’ve already entered your mobile number but want to remove it, simply go to HEngage.com, click on “Settings” and remove your mobile number.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--9"></a>What information about me can people see on HEngage.com?
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
We get that privacy is important. That’s why we let you customize your privacy settings on HEngage.com.
</div>
<div class="Standard">
You have the option to show your profile page to all coworkers or only coworkers who you are connected to. If you limit your privacy settings to those you are connected to, others will only be able to see your name, photo and email address. If a coworker wants to connect with you, they will request to be your friend. You’ll receive a notification that allows you to confirm or (quietly) reject them.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--10"></a>What if the system doesn’t recognize a command I send?
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
There are a few reasons that the system may not recognize a command that you send in. First, you may want to double-check what you sent us. For example, make sure that you spelled everything correctly (sent “benefit” not “bnefit”) and that words are in the right order (“4 ur health” not “ur 4 health”).
</div>
<div class="Standard">
And finally, if you’re still having issues, send <a href='#' class='contact_us_link'>support@hengage.com</a> a message and we’ll look into it.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--11"></a>What if I send a command and don’t receive a response back?
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
We try our best to respond to all commands within a few seconds. Like any system, ours slows down once in awhile so if you don’t see something right away, give us a few minutes. If you still don’t see a response within an hour, send us a note at <a href='#' class='contact_us_link'>support@hengage.com</a> and we’ll look into it.

</h1>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--12"></a>What if I found something that doesn’t look right?
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
We work hard to make sure that everything in our system is working correctly, but if you see something that doesn’t look right, let us know! Send us a note at <a href='#' class='contact_us_link'>support@hengage.com</a>. If you find a bug, we may even give you a couple bonus points for helping us out!
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--13"></a>A friend referred me to the game. How do I give them credit?
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
There are a few ways to give your referrer credit. The easiest is to respond to the welcome message you received when you joined with their user name. You can also give them credit when you log on to HEngage.com.
