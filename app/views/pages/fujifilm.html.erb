      <h2>Looking for new ways to engage employees</h2>
      <p>
        Carolyn Gordon, Director of Benefits at Fujifilm, was looking for new ways to engage a diverse workforce. Traditional communications like newsletters and posters werenâ€™t moving the needle on metrics like Health Assessment completion rates. In search of better engagement and more data, she decided to launch Airbo.
      </p>

      <h2>One place to communicate about any topic</h2>
      <p>Airbo gives Carolyn's team and her Towers Watson consultants one place to drive engagement in a wide variety of topics, from wellness to health care reform. In addition to providing a platform to create original content, the tool was also used to drive utilization of free resources provided by vendors, like financial education podcasts from Fidelity. </p>
