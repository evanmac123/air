  <h2 class="first">Welcome to your exclusive sneak peek of H Engage.</h2>

  <p>H Engage turns an existing communications campaign into a social game, and promotes behavior change by instantly rewarding positive lifestyle decisions.</p>

  <p>You can join the game by texting your first initial and last name as one word to <code>617-997-0269</code>. For example, Jane Doe would text <code>jdoe</code> to sign up.</p>

  <p>Once you're signed up, you can earn points by performing tasks and then texting key words with your cell phone.</p>

  <p>To earn points, look for posters with the H Engage logo at the top, and follow the instructions in the boxes at the bottom. You can also earn points by making healthy decisions like eating fruit.</p>

  <p>You can play the game until Friday at 10:30.  If you earn more than 60 points prior to the deadline, youâ€™ll be entered to win a prize. First and second place winners will receive a MasterCard gift card for $75 and $50, respectively.</p>

  <p>Top ten winners based on score will receive a specially commissioned t-shirt.</p>
