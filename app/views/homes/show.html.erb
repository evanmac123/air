  <p>H.Engage turns an existing communications campaign into a social game, and promotes behavior change by instantly rewarding positive lifestyle decisions.</p>

  <p>You can join the game by texting your first initial and last name as one word to <code>617-997-0269</code>. For example, Jane Doe would text <code>jdoe</code> to sign up.</p>

  <p>Once you're signed up, you can earn points by performing tiles and then texting key words with your cell phone.</p>

  <p>To earn points, look for posters with the H.Engage logo at the top, and follow the instructions in the boxes at the bottom. You can also earn points by making healthy decisions like eating fruit.</p>

  <p>You can play the game until Friday at 10:30.  If you earn more than 60 points prior to the deadline, youâ€™ll be entered to win a prize. First and second place winners will receive a MasterCard gift card for $75 and $50, respectively.</p>

  <p>Top ten winners based on score will receive a specially commissioned t-shirt.</p>
