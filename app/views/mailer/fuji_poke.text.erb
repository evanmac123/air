Hello <%= @user.first_name %>,

HealthFocus is a fun, social game that started in Valhalla last Wednesday. 

Over a hundred of your FUJIFILM coworkers are already playing!

To start playing and see what it's all about, <%= invitation_url(@user.invitation_code) %>.

How do I play?

After you sign-up, you can start earning points by:

* Eating healthy. Had a salad for lunch? Text or email "ate salad". Snacked on an apple? Text or email "ate apple". And so on...

* Doing physical activity. Took the stairs over the elevator? Text or email "took stairs". Went to the gym? Text or email "went to gym". And so on...

* Reading "tiles." Look for the fun, colorful squares and follow the instructions on each one. A new series is posted each week, so have your cell phone ready!

* Referring friends. Get 5 points for each coworker you sign up: have your friend respond to their welcome text or email with your user name and he or she will get +2 points.

* Playing together. You can earn extra points for doing an activity together by adding a friend's user name to the end of a command (for example, "took stairs jsmith"). You can also connect with coworkers at hengage.com or by sending "connect user name" (e.g. "connect jsmith").

Have fun and good luck!
H Engage
