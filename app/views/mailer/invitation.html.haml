%p We recently launched a new, social game, sponsored by Covidien and powered by H Engage. This round of the game will help you and your spouse/domestic partner learn about changes to your benefits and avoid paying up to $1,500 more on medical coverage in 2013. 

%p It's fun and easy. You can play via text message, email or online from any device -- at work, at home or on the go. [link]Click here to join[/link].

%p The more you play, the better your chances to win an iPad or a $500 Amazon gift card.

%p Join thousands already playing. See your coworkers' activity feeds in action.
