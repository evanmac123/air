Had a salad for lunch? Text or email "ate salad". Snacked on an apple? Text or email "ate apple". And so on...</li> <li>Doing physical activity. Took the stairs over the elevator? Text or email "took stairs". Went to the gym? Text or email "went to gym". And so on...</li> <li>Reading "tiles." Look for the fun, colorful squares and follow the instructions on each one.
