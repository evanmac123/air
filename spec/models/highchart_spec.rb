  # Okay, here's the deal: Hourly mode => all acts have to be within a 1-day, 24-hour period because that's how the query
  # fetches them. Not only that, but for this (and other) tests, we create acts around the "end points" of the day as
  # opposed to the "meat" of the day because that's where the more-complicated test cases arise. (Creating all acts
  # around 2 or 3 in the afternoon, while easier, wouldn't convince me that this code is thoroughly tested.)
  #
  # 'Hourly' is also a royal pain in the ass because Rails stores all times in UTC which is 4 or 5 hours ahead of EST,
  # depending on whether or not it is Daylight Savings time.
  #
  # We found a bug in Hourly where the times were off by 4 or 5 hours; the fix was to re-adjust the times back to EST.
  # What's that got to do with this test? Well, this test was set up to process acts that lived at the edges of a
  # 24-hour window. But when you adjust for the 5-hour difference... well, now those acts no longer live within that window.
  #
  # To make the 5-hour adjustment in the simplest, most understandable manner I did the following:
  # 1) Added 5 hours to the lower-level hours (1am, 2am, 3am) => they will still live within the 24-hour window.
  # 2) Unfortunately, doing the same thing to the higher-lever hours (9pm, 10pm, 11pm) would knock those guys out
  #    of the 24-hour window, so 5 hours gets subtracted from them down below in the 'y-values' hash.
  #
  # And if Phil ever assigns me *anything time-related in Rails* again.. well, he's bigger than me so I probably won't do anything.
