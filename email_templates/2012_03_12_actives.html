<p>Thousands of Highmark employees are playing H Engage. Together, you've taken 60,000 healthy actions in the last 4 weeks!</p>

<p>The iPad drawing is this Friday (March 16!) so rack up the points for more entries.</p>

<p>Looking for a new way to earn points? Now, you can now earn 2 points for each person you follow in H Engage. Just log on to the website and click "Directory." Search for a co- worker and click "Follow."</p>

<p>Feeling extra social? You can tag others in the commands that you send.</p>

<p>Going for a walk with a co-worker? Send in "took a walk USERNAME" (e.g., "took a walk jsmith"). They'll get bonus points. Make sure they return the favor!</p>

<p>Get going!</p>
