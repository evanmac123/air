Thousands of Highmark employees are playing H Engage. Together, you've taken 60,000 healthy actions in the last 4 weeks!

The iPad drawing is this Friday (March 16!) so rack up the points for more entries.

Looking for a new way to earn points? Now, you can now earn 2 points for each person you follow in H Engage. Just log on to the website and click "Directory." Search for a co- worker and click "Follow."

Feeling extra social? You can tag others in the commands that you send.

Going for a walk with a co-worker? Send in "took a walk USERNAME" (e.g., "took a walk jsmith"). They'll get bonus points. Make sure they return the favor!

Get going!
