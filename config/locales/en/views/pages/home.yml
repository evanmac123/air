          note_header: 'The Airbo Employee Communication Platform'
          note_header: 'For over six years, Airbo has pursued a simple mission based on a simple belief: HR and Corporate Communications are important.'
          note_p1: 'They connect employees with benefits that improve their lives. They weave employees into a greater company culture. But corporate communication tools just haven’t kept up with how today’s employees engage in the world around them.'
          note_p2_html: 'Intranets have become like filing cabinets &#8212; great for storage, not so great for engagement. Inboxes overflow with urgent messages and HR and Corporate communications get lost in the shuffle. A great deal of work goes underappreciated and even more work is created.'
          note_p3: 'Airbo’s Employee Communication Platform helps HR and Corporate Communications close the engagement gap. It helps make content as engaging as the consumer tools employees already love so that more employees read, understand, and take action, while HR and Corporate Communications have less administration and higher return from the programs they invest in.'
          note_p4: 'Explore how Airbo works below. If you have any questions, please feel free to chat with us.'
