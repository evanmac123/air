app/views/pages/fujifilm.html.erb:        Carolyn Gordon, Director of Benefits at Fujifilm, was looking for new ways to engage a diverse workforce. Traditional communications like newsletters and posters weren’t moving the needle on metrics like Health Assessment completion rates. In search of better engagement and more data, she decided to launch H.Engage.
app/views/pages/fujifilm.html.erb:      <p>H.Engage gives Carolyn's team and her Towers Watson consultants one place to drive engagement in a wide variety of topics, from wellness to health care reform. In addition to providing a platform to create original content, the tool was also used to drive utilization of free resources provided by vendors, like financial education podcasts from Fidelity. </p>
app/views/pages/fujifilm.html.erb:      <p>Over 60% of Fujifilm employees participate in H.Engage. Carolyn and her team have been able to show a real impact on employee behavior -- Health Assessment completion rates jumped from 17% in 2011 to 54% in 2012.</p>

Second, you’ll want to tell your IT department not to block emails from H.Engage.</p>
app/views/pages/pricing.html.erb:				<p>Just one thing. You’ll want to tell your IT department not to block emails from H.Engage. We provide exact language of what to tell them, and it only takes them a few minutes to actually do it.</p>
app/views/pages/pricing.html.erb:				<p>Yes. Just give yourself time to execute. You will not have access to reporting or any other Administrative capabilities once you turn H.Engage off.

app/views/pages/privacy.haml:  Your privacy is of the utmost importance to H.Engage. Our basic principles are:
app/views/pages/privacy.haml:    %li You as the user and we as H.Engage have entered a voluntary relationship in which we provide services and information to you. The data you disclose to us makes it possible to deliver the wellness services we provide.
app/views/pages/privacy.haml:  H.Engage's services may contain links to other web sites outside the Site, including on the sponsor’s website. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of other sites. When linking to another site a user should read the privacy policy stated on that site. This privacy policy only governs information collected on http://hengage.com (the “H.Engage Site”) and its related sponsor-specific privacy-protected sites (the “Employer Site” and, together with the H.Engage Site, the “Site”).
app/views/pages/privacy.haml:%p H.Engage will not sell, share, or rent your personal information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this Privacy Policy. While we may use this information to improve the services we offer you, we promise not to pass on personally identifiable information to third parties, except as stated herein or if you specifically give us permission to do so.
app/views/pages/privacy.haml:%p In order to use our services and participate in H.Engage, you create an account and provide contact and identity information and other personal information as indicated on the registration form, including your preferred screen name, email address, photo, gender, and date of birth. We may ask for additional information (such as your height and weight) in order to better serve you and customize your experience. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature. Your failure or unwillingness to provide certain information may mean that a service or feature will not be available to you. 
app/views/pages/privacy.haml:%p In addition to the information you choose to provide to us, H.Engage also collects and stores certain technical and other information about the online activities of our users—whether or not they are registered—on an aggregated (or collective) basis. This may include your IP address, browser type, and operating system. We track the number of people who view each page, and other site usage data, in order to learn which features are the most popular and thereby improve our service. We also record statistical information collected on the Site to better understand our audience. This information is recorded as anonymous group statistical information and is not connected to any personal information that you provide as a member.
app/views/pages/privacy.haml:%p From time to time we may provide you with periodic emails and text messages to let you know about improvements in our services, additional activities you may be interested in tracking, and changes to our terms of use or privacy policies. H.Engage may use URL tracking in the emails sent to you. When you open such email messages, our system may record the following data: the time you viewed the email and the URLs that you clicked on from that email. H.Engage will also record if your email program is capable of receiving HTML-encoded email. URL tracking may use cookies. You may always opt out of receiving H.Engage emails and/or text messages.
app/views/pages/privacy.haml:%p H.Engage maintains a newsfeed as one of its features.  Any comments you post on the newsfeed will be available for viewing on the Employer Site by all users.  We do not monitor usage, nor are we responsible for any personally identifying information that a user may post in our newsfeed or in blog responses on our blogs.  Users should take care in any public postings, and understand that anything posted by them may potentially be used by others on the Employee Site and therefore elsewhere.
